# Comparison of Javascript tools
This project was built in an attempt to self-teach various Javascript frameworks.

The same "project" is, in theory, replicated in various frameworks to help establish the similarities and differences between each framework, as well as just getting some 'hands on' experience.

## Current Frameworks
- React
- Vue.js

## Build Process
This project is hosted on Netlify.

Each new commit to the `master` branch triggers the build script which navigates into each sub-project, runs `npm start` to compile and build the app and then places them in a single directory underneath `dist`.

## Roadmap
:hammer::hammer: This is still a work in progress, and new frameworks will be added over time.
